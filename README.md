# UnityEssentials
A simple custom hierarchy that recolors prefab text that has overrides with a yellow color.

atm you are only able change the colors via hard coding in the script


Implementing the custom hierarchy (UnityEssentials):
- Download the project as a zip file
- Unpack it
- copy the Editor folder into your assets folder. If you already have an editor folder, copy the UnityEssentials folder instead.
should be ../Assets/Editor/UnityEssentials/UnityEssentials.cs

To edit the colors go to: Tools (top of the screen where the menus are) --> Hierarchy Editor
